        Odells article captivated my attention in several ways. Firstly, the
        history and nostalgia she presents of the early internet is a completely
        unfamiliar world to me, as I’m sure it is to most of the class. She goes
        on to comment on its progression, from the Gen Z DIY youtube era to the
        hyper commodified room tour videos of today. I’ve long been interested
        in the commodification of social media and the furthering detachment it
        exemplifies as we progress further into a hyper capitalist world. It
        seems Molly Soda is intrigued by this as well, shown through her 3D
        rendered house tour video and her website. The video is a deadpan
        critique of the room tours Odell talked so much about, and it begs the
        question: Is this 3D model house tour really that different from videos
        of real house tours? These videos are made by people with houses we will
        never see by people we really don't know. Who’s to say the videos Soda
        parodies aren't 3D renders too? Her website also speaks beautifully on
        this internet commodification and the female experience. Hyper
        sexualization, clickbait material, and emotional detachment are
        experiences and feelings that have culminated for Soda and many other
        mainly women. She conveys these feelings through a cluttered web page
        that due to its constant but sparse movement is comforting, like a home.
        This ties very well into what schwulst writes about in her article. She
        goes over the different ways a website can present itself: A shelf,
        plant, garden, etc.. All of these different analogies really open up the
        world of personal websites showing just how much control one can have
        over what they want to make. Discussion Questions: 1. How do you think
        we can bring back the sense of connection Odell talks about in her
        article? Do you feel that it's permanently lost? 2. Do you think the
        solution for moving away to this hyper consumptive aesthetic on the
        internet is one of regression? Like making social media and websites
        that resemble those of 10-20 years ago? 3.Can a professional, corporate
        appealing website have more personality than a cluttered art oriented
        one, like Molly Sodas?

        In Lara Baladi’s article she chronicles the 2011 Egyptian Uprisings
        through a lens of how technology, the internet, and specifically
        archivability has had such a dramatic impact on the revolution and
        outcomes. I found this read incredibly fascinating, especially when you
        think about how well it aligns historically with many other revolutions
        of the 20th and 21st century, but this one adds in modern elements. Lara
        starts with the ability to organize on the internet. In a modern world
        it only makes sense for the people to unite through what's at their very
        fingertips. Beyond the 2011 Egyptian Uprisings, we’ve witnessed the use
        of the internet for social and economic change in countless ways, most
        notably and recently during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Videos
        and photos of the Egyptian protests were quickly spread around Egypt and
        specifically Tahrir, uniting those in the fight against their regime. In
        revolutions, there are usually two phases, the economic, and the
        cultural. Usually the economic leads, but it's not rare for both to
        happen at once. Lara talks about how economic and political demands were
        made by the people, some met and some not. As the economy died down, the
        culture flourished. And what did this look like? A complete revolution
        in the Egyptian art scene. It was anti-establishment, revolutionary,
        jarring, and also made use of modern technology. The government's
        retaliation, an important part of any revolution, was also rooted in
        technology, through use of internet censorship. The point it feels Lara
        wants to get at with this article is that none of this would've been
        possible without the documentation and archival of events from countless
        people. It's a message for how to achieve unity, and how to remember, in
        the digital age. The link between Baladi’s article and Paul Soulellis’
        Eyeo video is pretty clearly both art born out of conflict and urgency,
        and the archival of digital culture. The former here Soulellis shows
        through example. Underrepresented, marginalized, or recently challenged
        communities making art not just out of passion for art but out of need
        for statement. The latter of these two subjects, Soulelli focuses on in
        a really intriguing way. He uses the ability to archive the internet
        fundamentally as a tool to show hypocrisy, and wrong doing. Using
        people's digital footprints against them, or just making them clear and
        preserved for everyone to see. Both of these ideas contribute to what
        Soulellis calls Urgentcraft. Discussion Questions What do you think of
        Soulelli defining Urgentcraft as “Taking up space to avoid the failures
        of our own history"? Do you agree with this statement? When it comes to
        socio political movements, is organizing in person still the most
        important factor? Or has internet unity become more important? Do you
        feel yourself personally contributing to any examples of Urgentcraft?

        I was really intrigued by the origins of the internet, but also not at
        all surprised. Not just modern but historically most technology has come
        at the creation of a governing body used for violence, protection, or
        oppression. The internet is one of the few underdogs who have, somewhat,
        escaped this grasp. It may have been borne for the use of few to
        control, but through its fatal flaw, of it being a tool to communicate,
        the people now have been able to have some say. This perspective often
        keeps me more optimistic about the internet’s progression.

        I found this week's reading some of the more difficult pieces for me to
        wrap my head around, but also the most fascinating. Black Gooey Universe
        was incredibly eye opening. There is of course a very apparent racism in
        the tech and internet industry,shown through sheer representation. But
        the actual components talked about in this article, especially the
        transition of the black to white screen, explain both the symbolic and
        beyond symbolic anti-blackness present with the actual technology. This
        is all used to talk about the theory of a new type of GUI, one that is
        inherently blak, and contradictory to current. Olia Lialina & Dragan
        Espenschied talk about the development of user interface and user
        experience in their article Rich User Experience, UX, and Desktopization
        of War. The idea they get into around half way in, of UX being this more
        humanized, reality mimicking concept, I found particularly interesting.
        I know the idea of the uncanny valley transfers visually, but what about
        through text based communications as well? Could there be a point in
        humanized and personalized UX that we find grossly unsettling? The
        desktopization of the war section was also really fascinating. It’s an
        idea I had thought about, war being remote and removed, but didn’t
        realize it was such a studied and researched phenomena. Do you think the
        idea of the uncanny valley applies to UX Design? Is the virtuality of
        modern war inherently less real feeling for those committing
        assassinations and other crimes? Should it be? Should virtual reality be
        integrated into the desktopization of war to resemble real life?

        I really enjoyed all the readings and viewings from this week. I think
        my conception of internet surveillance has kind of embarrassingly been
        this sort of surface level “orwellian” viewing of our relationship with
        surveillance. I viewed surveillance as this very top down, government
        pushed, equally pervasive idea. All of the pieces of media, particularly
        Harry’s work, really opened up my eyes to how fluid and multifaceted the
        issue of surveillance is. A lot of what Harry said was reminiscent of
        what I saw many people of color talk about during last year's BLM
        protests, how there is this almost necessity to see the physical
        brutality of black people for it to be legitimized. Harry also talks
        about surveillance from this very personal perspective too, which Lauren
        McCarthy elaborates a lot on. We live in an age where due to social
        media, the gig economy, and all other technological facets of our late
        stage capitalist world, we are being watched from all over. I was
        particularly intrigued by how McCarthy doesn't apply an inherently
        negative connotation to surveillance, how it is some kind of modern
        desire to be watched. And I think I agree with this idea, that as much
        as we like to separate ourselves from perception, we do have a need for
        it. So why can't that need be positively fulfilled? That's what I
        appreciate so much about McCarthy's work, it is theorizing solutions in
        a positive way. This runs very contrary to Hagborgs work, which gives
        off a much more dystopian solution. Obviously surveillance is a more
        severe and scientific concept in Hagborgs mind, so she can't be blamed
        for how she approaches it. Overall I think this week's reading brought a
        lot more out of me than past weeks, and I now feel pretty curious to
        explore surveillance in my own right. Do you think McCarthy’s more
        positive look at surveillance is an avenue that should be explored? How
        do you expect surveillance to become more pervasive? Do you think
        surveillance is inherently racist?

        In Mina’s video, Memes to Movements, we are given an understanding of
        how what has become a predominantly abstract and digital idea, the meme,
        has had an insane ability to affect real world material change. I think
        the main reason for this is the memes inherent collectivism. In itself
        it represents movements, by being shared, consumed, and not owned. As
        Mina talked about how many now popular political phrases and their
        respective remixes have started online like BLM and ALM, I began
        thinking of the commodification of these ideas, and how that relates to
        memes as well. These phrases collective existence allows for unlimited
        commodity, remix, irony, and misunderstanding. The idea of these phrases
        can very easily become far removed, and turned into symbols of
        practically nothing. This in itself, can also produce memes. In the
        example below, one can see how the commodification of such a serious
        message has a wild affect, as the wearer clearly seems far removed from
        all original meaning and appears in the attire for what is assumed
        social clout. The excerpt from Steyerl Wretched of the Screens was even
        more engaging for me. The idea of the poor image was very well
        articulated and made me think so much of its uses. I’d argue the poor
        image, if more broadly defined, is the most important piece of media
        available to us. It is persistent through social media, and its lack of
        perfection, through grain, noise, crop, etc. humanizes it. The latest
        iteration of the image we see was clearly directly altered by someone
        else, someone real. And in that we find more immediate connection than
        anything hyper commercialized. Example attached seems almost self aware
        of this idea. It is saying feel free to alter as has been done many
        times before you, adding a little bit of you to its history. The Glitch
        Manifesto also struck a chord with me. I was really drawn to this idea
        of rebellion but more so vulnerability that comes with a glitch- it’s
        not something meant to happen- it shows fault, and imperfection. I feel
        this pairing of fault and rebellion naturally don’t go well together,
        but in this context it creates something really beautiful. The most
        comparable idea to me is that of Gender Abolition, which is inherently
        both revolutionary and vulnerable. Questions: Can a poor image be made
        intentionally? Or can it only become through repost and repurpose? Do
        you think memes are now too ingrained in our modern culture? How can you
        see glitch culture evolve from here?

        This week’s reading and viewings all centered around the concept of
        algorithms, AI, and their seemingly inherent oppression. Joy Buolamwini
        talked a lot about facial recognition in her Ted talk, and how popular
        softwares is designed fully around a eurocentric face. She notes how
        dangerous this is in the identification process. If we use facial
        recognition software to criminalize individuals, and advanced softwares
        like her can barely recognize ablack person's face, how likely is a
        false identification of someone of color in the justice system? Mini
        Ohuaha also is intrigued by this type of unsure data collection. She
        particularly found interest in the distinguishment of data collection
        and categorization. What harm comes from using an AI to categorize and
        collect data? What kind of biases are enacted? These questions I think
        also tie well into Dinkins work. She poses a bottom up organization of
        AI and algorithmic building through her work and her article. It is
        inherent for black liberation to be one with these machines,to not allow
        them to continue their oppression through data stereotypes. This serves
        as part of the concept of afro nowism, which aims to cause a mental
        liberation, in the moment, for black people. Can AI be objective? Is a
        bias innate? Do you think part of the problem with data collection lies
        in the ways we do it? Why or why not? Should Machine Learning be
        regulated in any way to avoid their biases?

        I found Allhyari’s talk particularly interesting compared to the other
        reading of this week because it approaches a digital problem with a
        partially physical solution. I think there is a tendency of digital
        artists to explore digital problems through an entirely digital lens. I
        like Allhyari’s effort to subvert this, and it only works so well within
        her subject matter and medium. The idea of digital colonialism transfers
        well into Ross’s piece on Nonviolent code, particularly on the section
        Honor The Land. The style of writing in general throughout this article
        was very compelling. Each question provoked genuine thought, and I felt
        very suddenly that I needed to know a lot more about my own digital
        practices. I think I most connected with Ross through her mention in Yae
        Addae’s piece however. I’ve been eager to read more scholarly work from
        people of my generation, those who've been with the internet their
        entire lives. The ramifications of the internet on mental health to me
        have been pretty clear for a while, but I’ve always viewed it in this
        more unintentional way. Porn adverts, shock sites, viruses you
        accidently click on. Things younger people aren’t really meant to see
        that slip through the veil of security. But the idea of Data trauma
        shows just how intentional internet harm can really be. Do you think
        data trauma will only get worse over time? Is digital colonialism
        tangent to colonialism elsewhere? Which one of Ross’ questions stuck out
        to you the most?

        I really enjoyed browsing the cyberfeminism index site, there were a lot
        of different pieces I was intrigued by. I focused on Post-Coitis by Gita
        Hashemi. I was really intrigued by this project because of its roots and
        evolution. Originally, Post-Coitis functioned as an et based project,
        comentatiting largely and mainly on the war in Iraq, while tying in more
        subtly the idea of sexism through images of pornography and Hashemi’s
        own body scans. This work developed into a performance piece in 2011,
        that oddly functions similarly to the net piece. It feels stagnant,
        enlightening, and uncomfortable, much like the site. Ari Ciano’s talk on
        Omni-Specialized design was also really intriguing and made me more
        hopeful than most of the content we consume in this class. I was really
        intrigued by the idea, stemming from the Benjamin Bratton quote she
        used, how so muhc of learning going forward is the unlearning of the
        past. I have long tried to envision what I do through a lens of newness,
        which is almost impossible feeling sometimes but Ciano worded her
        thoughts and practices very well. I felt the last interview with Hamid
        Khan felt more in sync with the reading two weeks back on algorithmic
        bias, but still found it really engaging nonetheless. What do you think
        the main intersection of works on the cyberfeminism index was? Race?
        Sexuality? Where does omni-specialized design fall in the corporate
        world? Can there really be a for-profit approach? How can we, as
        everyday people, contribute to a body of works like Khan’s?
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        My favorite piece from the site was the collaborative page
        "Essence-Absence". I split my liking into both its design and
        theoretical basis. I like upon entering the website you plummet to the
        ground, and many of the pieces shown are too high to really get a full
        picture of, so you have to jump. It makes the site feel grounded, and
        attaches a higher meaning in the literally higher pieces shown. I also
        think the website talks about the Hegelian concept of Essence and
        Absence and their negation in a palpably modern way. I struggle to grasp
        a lot of Hegelian and Spinozan thought, but I felt I almost understood
        what the website was getting at here, which felt really cool.
