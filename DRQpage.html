      Odells article captivated my attention in several ways. Firstly, the
      history and nostalgia she presents of the early internet is a completely
      unfamiliar world to me, as I’m sure it is to most of the class. She goes
      on to comment on its progression, from the Gen Z DIY youtube era to the
      hyper commodified room tour videos of today. I’ve long been interested in
      the commodification of social media and the furthering detachment it
      exemplifies as we progress further into a hyper capitalist world. It seems
      Molly Soda is intrigued by this as well, shown through her 3D rendered
      house tour video and her website. The video is a deadpan critique of the
      room tours Odell talked so much about, and it begs the question: Is this
      3D model house tour really that different from videos of real house tours?
      These videos are made by people with houses we will never see by people we
      really don't know. Who’s to say the videos Soda parodies aren't 3D renders
      too? Her website also speaks beautifully on this internet commodification
      and the female experience. Hyper sexualization, clickbait material, and
      emotional detachment are experiences and feelings that have culminated for
      Soda and many other mainly women. She conveys these feelings through a
      cluttered web page that due to its constant but sparse movement is
      comforting, like a home. This ties very well into what schwulst writes
      about in her article. She goes over the different ways a website can
      present itself: A shelf, plant, garden, etc.. All of these different
      analogies really open up the world of personal websites showing just how
      much control one can have over what they want to make. Discussion
      Questions: 1. How do you think we can bring back the sense of connection
      Odell talks about in her article? Do you feel that it's permanently lost?
      2. Do you think the solution for moving away to this hyper consumptive
      aesthetic on the internet is one of regression? Like making social media
      and websites that resemble those of 10-20 years ago? 3.Can a professional,
      corporate appealing website have more personality than a cluttered art
      oriented one, like Molly Sodas?

      In Lara Baladi’s article she chronicles the 2011 Egyptian Uprisings
      through a lens of how technology, the internet, and specifically
      archivability has had such a dramatic impact on the revolution and
      outcomes. I found this read incredibly fascinating, especially when you
      think about how well it aligns historically with many other revolutions of
      the 20th and 21st century, but this one adds in modern elements. Lara
      starts with the ability to organize on the internet. In a modern world it
      only makes sense for the people to unite through what's at their very
      fingertips. Beyond the 2011 Egyptian Uprisings, we’ve witnessed the use of
      the internet for social and economic change in countless ways, most
      notably and recently during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. Videos
      and photos of the Egyptian protests were quickly spread around Egypt and
      specifically Tahrir, uniting those in the fight against their regime. In
      revolutions, there are usually two phases, the economic, and the cultural.
      Usually the economic leads, but it's not rare for both to happen at once.
      Lara talks about how economic and political demands were made by the
      people, some met and some not. As the economy died down, the culture
      flourished. And what did this look like? A complete revolution in the
      Egyptian art scene. It was anti-establishment, revolutionary, jarring, and
      also made use of modern technology. The government's retaliation, an
      important part of any revolution, was also rooted in technology, through
      use of internet censorship. The point it feels Lara wants to get at with
      this article is that none of this would've been possible without the
      documentation and archival of events from countless people. It's a message
      for how to achieve unity, and how to remember, in the digital age. The
      link between Baladi’s article and Paul Soulellis’ Eyeo video is pretty
      clearly both art born out of conflict and urgency, and the archival of
      digital culture. The former here Soulellis shows through example.
      Underrepresented, marginalized, or recently challenged communities making
      art not just out of passion for art but out of need for statement. The
      latter of these two subjects, Soulelli focuses on in a really intriguing
      way. He uses the ability to archive the internet fundamentally as a tool
      to show hypocrisy, and wrong doing. Using people's digital footprints
      against them, or just making them clear and preserved for everyone to see.
      Both of these ideas contribute to what Soulellis calls Urgentcraft.
      Discussion Questions What do you think of Soulelli defining Urgentcraft as
      “Taking up space to avoid the failures of our own history"? Do you agree
      with this statement? When it comes to socio political movements, is
      organizing in person still the most important factor? Or has internet
      unity become more important? Do you feel yourself personally contributing
      to any examples of Urgentcraft?

      I was really intrigued by the origins of the internet, but also not at all
      surprised. Not just modern but historically most technology has come at
      the creation of a governing body used for violence, protection, or
      oppression. The internet is one of the few underdogs who have, somewhat,
      escaped this grasp. It may have been borne for the use of few to control,
      but through its fatal flaw, of it being a tool to communicate, the people
      now have been able to have some say. This perspective often keeps me more
      optimistic about the internet’s progression.
