        This final P5 exercise utilizes the users video and audio input. It
        takes in the video and uses it as a texture on all sides of multiple
        rotating cubes. With increased volume, the tint of these cubes change
        and react. There is a sphere changing in size rapidly, and has it's
        light source alligned to mouse movements. The background is more subtely
        correlated to mouse movements, changing shades of pink over time. I
        designed this piece as something quick and easy one could use for music
        videos or other audio and visual interactive experiences.
