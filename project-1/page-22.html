      Donâ€™t you see it? <br />
      the one thing separating yourself from the void? <br />
      In the black screen? <br />
      Looking back at yourself, through your two eyes. <br />
      You vile creature <br />
      You despicable being. <br />
      Lucky to have the opportunity to not live with your actions. <br />
      Click it or not. <br />
