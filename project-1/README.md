The Only Way Out

![demo]()

[Project 1 name](http://nwforman.github.io/iml300/project-1) is a multi narrative website project by Nicholas Forman.

### Description

"The Only Way Out" is a site designed to critique an elementary idea of accelerationism. On top a glitching galaxy background, the user is presented with an image, a corresponding poem, and a "Destroy" button. These items grow in importance, and eventually cross the bridge into sentience. After clicking the destroy button the image is destructively altered, a vase becomes shattered, a pig gets beheaded. Once the images become sentient, a dating ad pops up on the users left side of the screen. Depending on when it is clicked, the user will get one of two images that when continuously clicked create a visual poem of ad cut outs. The two positive endings focus on finding love within and looking towards the future. If the user clicks the ad past the destruction of a human life, then they are given an ad ending in which they are told theyâ€™ll die alone. Clicking destroy all the way throughout results in one ending the experience by clicking destroy to end up on a 404 page.
